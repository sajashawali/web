            <h3>Onlin Library System</h3>
            <p>Implementing an online library platform, the library provides a collection of regular books, each of which is distinguished by a title, author(s), country of publication, genre, language, and availability attribute. When books are borrowed or returned, their data must be updated immediately. In addition, the library offers e-books, which include attributes such as title, author(s), country of publication, genre, language, and URL. Authors are distinguished by their first name, middle name, last name, email, and biography. Furthermore, the library employs a librarian with attributes including first name, last name, and salary. This unique librarian plays a pivotal role in centralizing control over the libraryâ€™s vast collection. It is worth noting that the library offers a unique service whereby customers can express their interest in borrowing an unavailable book by signing up with the receptionist. The receptionist in turn sends email notifications to all interested customers when the book becomes available for borrowing. This service ensures effective communication and accessibility for library users.</p>
